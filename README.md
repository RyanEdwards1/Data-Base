# Data-Base


## ERD
##### Below you can see the ERD which is a quick overview how the database will look, function and what it will contain. Under each of the database titles there are multiple Skills, ID, HP, Damage and many others. 

##### As you can see on the ERD some of the tables are linked to one another for example the ‘Heroes’ table is linked to the ‘Heroes Talents’. This means that information can link between them. At the bottom you can see ‘Skills’ which all of the tables link to this table will contain the damage the skills do and the name of then the range of them and if they can heal then how much it will heal. 

##### Overall the ERD is a template of what the data base that will be created will look like, contain and the purpose of it.
