## ERD
#### Below you can see the ERD which is a quick overview how the database will look, function and what it will contain. Under each of the database titles there are multiple Skills, ID, HP, Damage and many others. 

#### As you can see on the ERD some of the tables are linked to one another for example the ‘Heroes’ table is linked to the ‘Heroes Talents’. This means that information can link between them. At the bottom you can see ‘Skills’ which all of the tables link to this table will contain the damage the skills do and the name of then the range of them and if they can heal then how much it will heal. 

#### Overall the ERD is a template of what the data base that will be created will look like, contain and the purpose of it.

## Data Dictionary
#### Below you can see a Data Dictionary for the database that I am creating. These dictionaries are to help the viewer understand. What type of input the table area will have, for example certain areas will have "float". This is to indicate whether there would be numbers or letters within the field of input. Data dictionaries are important as they can keep the database consistent from the start by giving it a set point as it allows viewers to look onto a clear view of what the database is going to be like and can always be referred to when putting the database together.

#### This data dictionary shows how my database will be made and what the value type they are. I will be able to use this dictionary as a fixed layout of the database when creating the final piece. I know what I must add and I know it’s everything I need all I should do is put it into a database. The dictionary helps keep me on track
